abstract = {Abstract We developed an extensive database of landscape metrics for ~2.65 million stream segments, and their associated catchments, within the conterminous United States (U.S.): The Stream‐Catchment (StreamCat) Dataset. These data are publically available (http://www2.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat) and greatly reduce the specialized geospatial expertise needed by researchers and managers to acquire landscape information for both catchments (i.e., the nearby landscape flowing directly into streams) and full upstream watersheds of specific stream reaches. When combined with an existing geospatial framework of the Nation's rivers and streams (National Hydrography Dataset Plus Version 2), the distribution of catchment and watershed characteristics can be visualized for the conterminous U.S. In this article, we document the development and main features of this dataset, including the suite of landscape features that were used to develop the data, scripts and algorithms used to accumulate and produce watershed summaries of landscape features, and the quality assurance procedures used to ensure data consistency. The StreamCat Dataset provides an important tool for stream researchers and managers to understand and characterize the Nation's rivers and streams.}
